## üéà Usage <a id="usage" name="usage"></a>

### Running the Application Locally

To run your Next.js application locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages by running `npm install` in your project
   directory.
2. add the environment variable
3. Build the application by running `npm run build`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the application.

For more information on running a Next.js application locally, check out the
official documentation.

## üöÄ Deployment <a id="deployment" name = "deployment"></a>

The fastest way to deploy a Next.js application is by using Vercel. Vercel
automatically detects Next.js and runs `next build` when you push your code to a
Git repository. It also optimizes the build output for you, including:

- Persisting cached assets across deployments if unchanged
- Immutable deployments with a unique URL for every commit

To deploy your Next.js application to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on Vercel.
2. Connect your Git repository to Vercel.
3. Configure your deployment settings, such as environment variables and custom
   domains.
4. Deploy your application.

For more information on deploying a Next.js application, check out the
[official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).
